This is a demo application built to help demonstrate our company's vision to potential users and investors.  

It should easily allow a user to identify where cost changes and time changes occur via visuals in a gantt chart as well as a time-cost calculator that would dynamically update throughout the journey/questionnaires. 
Color changes in the text should help users quickly identify cost savings and time savings, which will also be coupled with realistic information about what that choice means in the questionnaire space.

This application was built in two days.
It was built using matplotlib and Customtkinter primarily.
It was built in coordination with a project manager and designer to meet specifications and achieve user-friendly outcomes.
